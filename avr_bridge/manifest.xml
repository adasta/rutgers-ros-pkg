  <description brief="avr_bridge">

avr_bridge is meant to be bridge between an avr microcontroller and ROS.
This is supposed to allow us to send arbitrary data structures over 
serial and have them be published in ROS.  It features a avr C++ code 
generator (gen_avr.py) , a serial to ros bridge (bridge_node.py), and a
udev script system to automatically name your aduino the correct hardware
device name.
